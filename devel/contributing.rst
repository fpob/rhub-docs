Reporting a bug
---------------

Check if the bug was already reported in the Github Issues. If it is not there,
feel free to open a new issue. Make sure to follow the template and include all
relevant information.

If you want to:

- suggest some new feature/functionality to the team
- discuss some new feature/functionality you want to implement before starting
  the actual development
- ask any question related to features/functionalities

then please follow the appropriate template while creating the issue, and
provide as much information as possible.

Sending a pull request with a patch/feature/fix
-----------------------------------------------

To send a pull request:

1. Fork the project.
2. Make sure a bug report / feature request / question was previously opened so
   it can be related and validated.
3. Commit your changes. Please provide concise commits, with a reasonable and
   descriptive commit message.
4. Follow the pull request template, making sure to provide as much information
   as needed.

Pull requests will be accepted when, and only when:

- All of the test suites are passing
- The changeset is approved by one or more team members

If the commit message(s) need to be adjusted or clarified, the team may `squash`
your commits before merging.
